# Hotel_Resort_Booking_Data_Analysis

•	In this project I performed analysis on a raw hotel dataset containing 120k records of hotels and resorts and 32 features to understand hotel type by market segment based on customer nights spent at hotels and resorts.

•	To understand the revenue of hotel and resorts I decided to analyze the busiest months by seasons which will help to know when the customer traffic is maximum during which season and what prices customers pay for a type of rooms, and quantify statistics related to customer stay and origin.

•	Hotels and resorts can adjust their pricing strategies to optimize revenue generation during high-demand periods and offer competitive pricing during off-peak seasons to attract customers.

•	Analysis can guide decision-making regarding room inventory, pricing, and revenue management strategies. Understanding which types of rooms generate higher revenue during specific seasons allows hotels and resorts to optimize their offerings and allocate resources effectively.
